# 1. Import pandas


# 2. Read the "metacritic2.csv" file, and save the data in a dataframe variable. Print the data




# 3. Create a new dataframe with only Mario Games. Save that in a new dataframe variable and print that data (this will involve Boolean indexing)




# 4. Sort the Mario data by release year in descending order. (a .sort_values() function exists)




# 5. Last time we used a loop to find individual data on different platforms, years, etc. There is a .groupby() function that exists as well. Let's start by grouping by Release Year. Run the following code:
# <var> = <dataframe>.groupby("Release Year").count()
# What does it seems like count presents?



# 6. Use groupby again, but this time on Platform. Afterwards, run .count(), .mean(), and .median(). Which platform looks like it has the best games?



# 7. Create a new dataframe from the HunterAMC.csv file.


# 8. In that csv, contest 0 is the AMC 10, and contest 2 is the AMC 12. Create two separate dataframes containing data from the two different contests.



# 9. Find the average scores for each contest.



# 10. For each column, count how often each answer choice was selected.
